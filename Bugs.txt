Unresolved bugs I have noticed

Physics engine freezes when clipping between wall and object with 0 velocity.
Only happened once and have been unable to recreate.

Sometimes collisions act like they have friction of sorts when colliding.
But more extreme.
Like sometimes the velocity along the axis perpendicular to the collision will completely flip.
I believe it is due to my handling of corner collisions but I am not sure how.
Unable to consistently recreate.
