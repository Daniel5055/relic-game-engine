Unresolved bugs I have noticed

1. SOLVED - accidental redecleration of "dynamic_id" meaning it could never be = 1
Physics engine freezes when clipping between wall and object with 0 velocity.
Only happened once and have been unable to recreate.

2. 
Sometimes collisions act like they have friction of sorts when colliding.
But more extreme.
Like sometimes the velocity along the axis perpendicular to the collision will completely flip.
I believe it is due to my handling of corner collisions but I am not sure how.
Unable to consistently recreate.

3. SOLVED - Was an issue with deterimining which object was more negative in position as I took their influence rect positions instead of their real positions
Rigid body seemed to go at least 5 pixels into a static body before anti clipping triggers?
Likely a collision problem with high speeds?
Only seen once


4. LIKELY SOLVED - Have not been able to recreate and likley solved with 3.
Rigidbody seemed to be stuck in wall for a second, triggering anti clip 10 times before escaping
Not sure if this actually happened though because I am not sure if that is what really happened
